# Community Detection in Multi-Aspect Functional Brain Networks: Robust Tensor Decomposition Approach

This repository includes codes to run community detection in Multi-Aspect Functional Brain Networks as described in [[1]](#1). Although the paper's focus is EEG networks, the method can be applied to any type of multi-Aspect networks.
