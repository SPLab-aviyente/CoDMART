# Community Detection in Multi-Aspect Functional Brain Networks: Robust Tensor Decomposition Approach

This repository includes codes to run Community Detection in Multi-Aspect Functional Brain Networks as described in [[1]](#1). Although the paper focuses on EEG networks, the method can be applied to any type of multi-Aspect networks. A multi-aspect network can be modeled as follows:

## Usage

Please see `demo_CoDMART.m` under the main folder.
Please run the m-file `run_me_first.m` before running the demo.

## Installation

Once you download the repo, you need also to download the Tensors toolbox [[2]](#2)
